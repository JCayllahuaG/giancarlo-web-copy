## CSS Framework: TailwindCSS       

We use Tailwind CSS and Vue.js in this project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Together, they allow for faster development, improved maintainability, and a streamlined workflow.
